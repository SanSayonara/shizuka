# Shizuka: An easy way to create Discord bots with reusable code.

The title says what it is, I create Shizuka to develop my Discord bots faster using a plugin system, advanced timers and better functionalities for single-server bots (to do).

## Installation

1) You need to install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
2) Rename config-example.json to config.json and edit it with your Discord bot data.

3) Compile TypeScript

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
